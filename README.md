# World_Weather_Analysis
The purpose of this project was to create a program that would integrate user input statements based on the type of weather they were interested in when deciding where they would like to go on vacation. Once the type of weather was decided, potential travel destinations and nearby hotels would popup for the traveler to narrow down their selection. Based off the geographic area, four cities are chosen and an itinerary is build to navigate between the waypoints back to the original starting point. Summaries and graphics of each section are shown below:
