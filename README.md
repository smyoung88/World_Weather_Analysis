# World_Weather_Analysis
The purpose of this project was to create a program that would integrate user input statements based on the type of weather they were interested in when deciding where they would like to go on vacation. Once the type of weather was decided, potential travel destinations and nearby hotels would popup for the traveler to narrow down their selection. Based off the geographic area, four cities are chosen and an itinerary is build to navigate between the waypoints back to the original starting point. Summaries and graphics of each section are shown below:

## Weather Database
This section generated a random sample of 2000 cities worldwide and various respective weather conditions.

## Vacation Search
Input statements were retrieved from customers based on their weather preferences. Those preferences were used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels at those locations. A marker layer map with pop-up markers was generated based of their preference and is shown below:

## Vacation Itinerary
Finally, the customer chose four different cities to travel between. A travel itinerary was created that shows the route between the four cities and a marker layer map with pop-up markers for each city was created and is shown below:
